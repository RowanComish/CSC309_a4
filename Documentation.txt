i)
       Feed is a platform created using node.js and mongoDB, we used express and mongoose for the main part of the back end. Most of the work is done through the router which handles the get requests from the front end. It runs simple queries, as well as uses the Async module for handling multiple queries and rendering the EJS files with appropriate data. For security and social media integration we used Passport, and B-crypt.
       For the front end we used EJS, this allowed us to receive whatever data we wanted from the server and parse it on the web page. It makes it easier since we are generally going to be displaying multiple things of the same type(queries) and styling. Coupled with EJS, we used bootstrap since it was simple enough and provided a fairly quick formatting.
ii)
       The front-end will have a toolbar with various options to browse the site and login. It will depend on whether a user is logged in, for what they can do around the site. Everything is loaded via a get or post request from the front-end. This request sends data to the server, which sends it through our router to be handled. The router will perform the appropriate action, whether it be querying from the database, updating/deleting from the database, verifying user login and then render those results to the EJS files, where the data is parsed, formatted and displayed, based off of the information provided to the page.
