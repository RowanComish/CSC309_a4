##About
Feed is a Sharing Economy web application, designed to allow people to order food from cooks in their area. The application allows users
to create recipes at any cost they would like, and have other users order these recipes. The users who order can then review the recipes 
and leave comments on how they felt about the recipe. 

##Functionality
Feed is fairly straight forward! It's highly recommended to first make an account. Once you've done this by signing up in the top right 
corner, you can select any recipe. On the recipe page, feel free to 'Order' any of the recipes, where it will then be added to 'Your Orders' 
(available in the top right corner of the page). All orders, both past and presently in the 'Queue' are found here. You can remove any of
the orders from the list if you have changed your mind, or you can click 'Order your food!' to have your order 'fulfilled' (in the current
demo, we do not have payment and pretend that the order is immediately completed). Once an order is in the 'Past Orders' area, we can leave
a review!
